Bosch BMA421
############


this driver does not exist, so it has been created.
Still work in progress ....


.. code-block:: console

      west build -p -b pinetime samples/gui/lvaccel 




Overview
********


BMA421 is not a part number available to the general public, and therefore all the supporting documentation and design resources are neither discussed in public forums, nor disclosed on GitHub. 

CHIP_ID=0X11  (so the Bosch BMA423 drivers need to be adapted)

The Bosch documentation on the bma423 seems to apply to the bma421.



Requirements
************


for this sensor does not exist any driver, so here's what I did to create one under zephyr

adapt CMakeLists.txt
--------------------
~/zephyrproject-2/zephyr/drivers/sensor
add_subdirectory_ifdef(CONFIG_BMA280            bma280)
add_subdirectory_ifdef(CONFIG_BMA421            bma421)


add yaml file
-------------
~/zephyrproject-2/zephyr/dts/bindings/sensor
cp bosch,bma280-i2c.yaml  bosch,bma421-i2c.yaml

edit KConfig
------------

source "drivers/sensor/bma280/Kconfig"
                                                                                                                                                                                         source "drivers/sensor/bma421/Kconfig"

source "drivers/sensor/bmc150_magn/Kconfig"

source "drivers/sensor/bme280/Kconfig"


create driver
-------------
see under drivers/sensor/bma421

complement the pinetime.dts file with the following (under samples/sensor/bma280) 

.. code-block:: console

     &i2c1 {
             bma421@18 {
                 	compatible = "bosch,bma421"; 
     	        	reg = <0x18>;
     	 	        label = "BMA421";
     		        int1-gpios = <&gpio0 8 0>;
     	               };
            };
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Create a file: `/dts/bindings/sensor/bosch,bma421-i2c.yaml`.
Which contains:

::

     compatible: "bosch,bma421"
     include: i2c-device.yaml
     properties:
            int1-gpios:
            type: phandle-array
            required: false



Building and Running
********************


Todo
****

    - the driver is interrupt driven as well -- need to adapt software
    - the sensor has algorithm for steps -- read out register
    - temperature some attempt has been made, but ...
